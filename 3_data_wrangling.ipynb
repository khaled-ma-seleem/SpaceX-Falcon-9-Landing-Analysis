Sometimes a landing was attempted but failed due to an accident; for example, <code>True Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a specific region of the ocean while <code>False Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a specific region of the ocean. <code>True RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a ground pad <code>False RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a ground pad.<code>True ASDS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully landed on  a drone ship <code>False

orbit with an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less (approximately one-third of the radius of Earth),[1] or with at least 11.25 periods per day (an orbital period of 128 minutes or less) and an eccentricity less than 0.25.[2] Most of the manmade objects in outer space are in LEO <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit'>[1]</a>.\n\n* <b>VLEO</b>: Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO) can be defined as the orbits with a mean altitude below 450 km. Operating in these orbits can provide a number of benefits to Earth observation spacecraft as the spacecraft operates closer to the observation<a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271499606_Very_Low_Earth_Orbit_mission_concepts_for_Earth_Observation_Benefits_and_challenges'>[2]</a>.\n\n\n* <b>GTO</b> A geosynchronous orbit is a high Earth orbit that allows satellites to match Earth's rotation. Located at 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) above Earth's equator, this position is a valuable spot for monitoring weather, communications and surveillance. Because the satellite orbits at the same speed that the Earth is turning, the satellite seems to stay in place over a single longitude, though it may drift north to south,” NASA wrote on its Earth Observatory website <a  href=\"https://www.space.com/29222-geosynchronous-orbit.html\" >[3] </a>.\n\n\n* <b>SSO (or SO)</b>: It is a Sun-synchronous orbit  also called a heliosynchronous orbit is a nearly polar orbit around a planet, in which the satellite passes over any given point of the planet's surface at the same local mean solar time <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit\">[4] <a>.\n    \n    \n    \n* <b>ES-L1 </b>:At the Lagrange points the gravitational forces of the two large bodies cancel out in such a way that a small object placed in orbit there is in equilibrium relative to the center of mass of the large bodies.

Also known as an intermediate circular orbit.
